# BeanBoard RA8875 Hardware SPI Example

This is a work in progress!

An accompanying schematic will be provided soon.

An example demonstrating how to interface the BeanBoard with an RA8875-based TFT display using a hardware SPI implemented in 74-series logic, using the BeanBoard GPIO, and an external control register.
